## üí™üí™ Why YoBulk will be an developer's choice:

- YoBulk uses nodejs streaming,so importing large CSV is superfast.
- Framework is ready for adding your custom validation functions.
- Easy to use and develop built on top of next.js.
- A real and powerfull framework which uses the real power of opensource CSV libraries.
- Bulit on top of mongo.We have plans to add support for SQL databases.üòÅ
- Both standalone importer and a template based importer for SaaS is available.
- Making sure CSV importing edge cases, so you never again have to worry about importing customer data to your database.
- We are adding a ML module for automatching and auto correction of CSV import error.

## Advantages

There are closed source solutions in the market. But, YoBulk is the only and first open source system which is developed by developers for developers.

We have a very strong and agggressive product roadmap encompassing the inclusion of Bigdata & AI/ML

‚úÖ The most significant advantage of having YoBulk is keeping your data on your own servers.As a SaaS application, you should not export your customer data to any
other 3rd party cloud for processing and think much about webhooks and data exchange complexites.

ü§ì As an open-source software, together, we will be building YoBulk with various feebacks and suggestions.

üíô No vendor lock-in. We strongly believe that CSV and any other flatfile importing should be a open source project and YoBulk is creating an OSS standard for data onboarding.
