## Advantages

There are closed source solutions in the market,But YoBulk is the single and first open source framework which is developed by developers for developers.
We have a very strong and agggressive product roadmap.

‚úÖ The most significant advantage of having YoBulk is keeping your data on your own servers.As a SaaS,you should not export your customer data to any 
other 3rd party cloud for processing and think much about webhooks and data exchange complexites.

ü§ì As an open-source software, We will be building YoBulk with your input and suggestion.

üíô No vendor lock-in. We strongly believe that CSV and any other flatfile importing should be a open source project and YoBulk is creating an OSS standard for data onboarding.
